# ColorSpeed
This Game was implemented by me with Java using the Java-Framework libGDX. It is available for Android/iOS/Web and Desktop. 

The goal of the game is to choose the right color and click the balls before they reach the center of the Screen. The actual chosen color can be seen on the top right corner.
